# Reflection

## What I would have done differently
- comment code from the start and keep it efficient
- also keep it dynamic/relative, do not hardcode from the beginning becuase it will be hard to change it back later and it's easy to go too far
    - I had to make a new file because I did this

## Hardest part of project
- I created each block in the form of a small 2d array, which was not the size of the master array. 
- The hardest part was figuring out the logic to link the array of the block to the array of the board. I ended up defining x and y variables and using a for loop to set the current grid to the block grid starting at that x and y value. 

## Did you complete the needs to have list?
Yes, I completed all items from my needs to have list 

## What are you most proud of?
- The project as a whole basically. When I first started I had no idea how I would approach this and it took me very long to get a block to even move left and right. I took this step by step, function by function and eventually it turned into a recognizable game.
